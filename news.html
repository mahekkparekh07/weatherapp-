								<p>Eight people died and seven others were injured Saturday after a gunman opened fire
									at an outdoor mall north of Dallas, Texas, officials said.

									<br>
									<br>
									The alleged gunman died after a confrontation with police at the Allen Premium
									Outlets, the scene of the shooting, Allen Police Department officials said. Nine
									additional people were transferred to hospitals, where two later died, officials
									said. The hospitalized victims' ages range from 5 to 61 years old, authorities said.

								<div class="featured-image"><img src="images/featured-image-2.jpg" alt=""></div>
								<p>A walkout by most Republicans in the Oregon Senate aimed at delaying action on gun
									safety, abortion rights and gender-affirming health care bills extended to a fifth
									day Sunday

									<br>
									<br>
									SALEM, Ore. -- A walkout by most Republicans in the Oregon Senate aimed at delaying
									action on gun safety, abortion rights and gender-affirming health care bills
									extended to a fifth day Sunday.

									Senate President Rob Wagner adjourned the body until Monday morning because a quorum
									could not be reached.
									<br>
									<br>
									Republicans have staged walkouts before, but this year legislators with 10 unexcused
									absences are disqualified for reelection, thanks to a new constitutional amendment
									overwhelmingly approved by voters in November.
									<br>
									<br>
									The boycott comes as several statehouses, including in Montana and Tennessee, have
									become battlegrounds between conservatives and liberals. Oregon has increasingly
									been divided between liberal population centers like Portland and Eugene and its
									mostly conservative rural areas.

								<div class="featured-image"><img src="images/featured-image-3.jpg" alt=""></div>
								<p>
									As the U.S. moves into a new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the public health
									emergency ending May 11, it also signals the end of some COVID data sharing.
									<br>
									<br>
									On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that it would be
									transitioning certain COVID metrics to other sources or discontinue them entirely
									once the emergency expires.
									<br>
									<br>
									Additionally, earlier this year, several data trackers -- including the John Hopkins
									University Coronavirus Resource Center and the U.S. Department of Health & Human
									Survives dashboard -- shut down.
